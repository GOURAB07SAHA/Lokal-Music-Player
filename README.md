# 🎵 Lokal Music Player – Intern Assignment

A high-performance music streaming application built with **React Native (Expo)** and **TypeScript**, powered by the **JioSaavn API**. This project focuses on native-level audio handling, complex state synchronization, and persistent user sessions.

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GOURAB07SAHA/Lokal-Music-Player.git
cd MusicPlayerApp
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Start the application

```bash
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with **Expo Go (Android)** or the **Camera app (iOS)** to run the app on your physical device.

## 🏗 Architecture

The application is designed with a **clear separation of concerns** to meet the **Key Challenges** of the assignment:

### 🔹 API Service

A dedicated service layer to interact with the JioSaavn API endpoints:

* `/api/search/songs`
* `/api/songs/{id}`

### 🔹 Audio Engine

Powered by **expo-av**, enabling:

* Background playback
* Music continuation when the app is minimized or the screen is off

### 🔹 Navigation

Implemented using **React Navigation v6** with a **Stack-based structure**, strictly avoiding **Expo Router** as required.

### 🔹 State Management

Uses **Zustand** to ensure the **Mini Player** and **Full Player** remain perfectly synchronized across all screens.

## 🧠 Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

### 🔸 Zustand over Redux

Zustand was chosen for its:

* Lightweight footprint
* Minimal boilerplate
* Excellent real-time synchronization for audio playback state

### 🔸 AsyncStorage for Persistence

AsyncStorage is used to persist:

* Playback queue
* Last played song

This ensures the queue remains intact even after app restarts.

### 🔸 Native Audio Handling

Playback progress and seek functionality are handled through native audio callbacks to avoid UI lag and ensure smooth performance.
